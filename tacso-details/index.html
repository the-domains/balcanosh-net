Communication Expert </p><p>TACSO Regional Office</p><p>Since it became operational, the TACSO Web site has had over 2,390,000 page views made by over 317,000 unique visitors. The increase of visits to the TACSO Web site is constant, which shows that we have found good measure in publishing timely and relevant information. Ever since it was published on line in February 2010, the TACSO web site grows with vast amounts of documents and photos being added daily.
 
Our intent is to keep the home page user friendly and dynamic, thus we have News section which displays the latest information (from News section, Reports, CSF Regional Grants News, Open Calls, Vacancies section, etc.) </p><p> In addition to the News section we have three additional windows with dynamic content (Documents, TACSO Calls and EU Calls). 
 
The basic information about the project is available at horizontal (top) menu under “Organisation”, where information about the staff and offices can be found. The major category in the top menu is called “Documents”. </p><p>In this section we have placed: </p><p>1.       Newsletters – all Newsletters (Regional TACSO office weekly eNewsletter, National and Regional Newsletters are placed here) </p><p>2.       Reports – in this section we are publishing all Reports done by or for TACSO (i.e. Needs Assessments, Conference Reports, etc.) </p><p>3.       Local Advisory Groups – in this section the minutes from all LAG meetings are published, in addition this section has a sub-section called “LAG Members” where more information on the role of LAGs is placed, as well as the list of LAG members per country. </p><p>4.  Other documents – is section were we publish reports that are owned by other organizations (EU, projects and similar), here we are also publishing some of the TACSO additional project information such as brochures, or DG Enlargement Guidelines. </p><p>5.       TACSO Manuals – is the section where you can find the Manuals produced by TACSO on CSO Management, Fundraising and Accessing EU Funds, Developing and Managing EU-Funded Projects, CSO and Citizens’ Participation, Media Relations for CSOs. </p><p>Also here you can find the Guide for Trainers on the mentioned topics.
 
Additionally, the TOP menu contains the section on “Capacity Development” with the information on TACSO expert roster, FAQs on PADOR, training videos and materials and more information on TACSO events.
 
On the right hand side of the TACSO home page we have placed vertical or right menus. </p><p>The first right menu gives you the option to choose one of TACSO national offices, in order to directly access the information from respective country in the local language. </p><p>The second right menu (the blue buttons) is used for emphasis of some issues and is subject to occasional changes in accordance with the importance of the topics. </p><p> The most popular sections in the blue buttons right menu are the following sections: </p><p>1.       Calendar – where we publish events of TACSO, FPAs and other regional and international events we receive information about. It provides clear overview of the activities of the CSOs related events in the region. </p><p>2.       CSO toolkit – is a section we envisaged as the “first aid kit” for CSOs – an online source of various TACSO documents including manuals, guides and glossaries as well as documents produced by the EU, CONCORD and other organisations. The documents are available to everyone and are meant to serve as a resource for work within the CSO, EU environment. Information in these documents can be useful for the purpose of networking and partnership-making, applying to TACSO open calls, conducting monitoring and guidance as well as trainings and dealing with various financial issues. While some documents focus on a particular country in the TACSO project, the information may serve as a good source of best practices. </p><p>3.       CSF Regional Grants – is a section that contains information about the CSF awarded projects and grants (with special News section), includes information about the: </p><ul><li>IPA Call 128286; </li><li>IPA Call 128287; </li><li>Framework partnerships (IPA 132438); </li><li>Operating Grants (IPA 136034) and also </li><li>Long Term Grants (IPA 151014). </li></ul><p> As you are aware, since July 2013 our Web site is opened to the CSF Regional Grants projects. The section for LTGs is added and you can check the information we posted about each of your projects. </p><p> We provide a space on www.tacso.org (CSF Regional Grants News) for LTGs to publish their: </p><ul><li>Open calls for conferences, </li><li>workshops, </li><li>trainings; </li><li>Vacancies that include volunteering positions; </li><li>Articles from events; </li><li>Reports; and </li><li>Calendar events. </li></ul><p>Criteria for submitting a news item from your FPA to the TACSO Communication Unit (web.team@tacso.org) is: </p><ul><li>The information needs to be in English (we will do basic proofreading); </li><li>The title needs to be developed by the FPAs; </li><li>FPA contact information should be clear and correct; and </li><li>Include photos if possible. </li></ul><p> If you would like to publish news items from your FPA, please download one of the templates (attached to this e-mail) and send this template and other documents (if any) to the TACSO Communication Unit at web.team@tacso.org.
