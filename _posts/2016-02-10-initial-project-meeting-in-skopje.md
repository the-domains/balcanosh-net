During February 8th and 9th 201u6 we had very nice opportunity to meet each other in Skopje, and first hand to discuss starting the regional project. 

Just to remind everybody, at the meeting were representatives from the Project Partners (Serbian Occupational Safety and Health Association, Montenegrin occupational safety and health association, Albanian Occupational Safety and Health Center, Kosovar Occupational Safety and Health Association and the host of the event Macedonian Occupational Safety and Health Association) and Associate Partner Organizations such as Bulgarian Occupational and Health Foundation, Institution for Occupational Safety and Health from UK, Society of Safety Engineers from Ljubljana (Slovenia) and Croatian Institute for Occupational Safety and Health

Hope you all had good time and now much more things are clearer than used to be.
