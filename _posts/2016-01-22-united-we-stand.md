# United we stand

Dear colleagues,

We are starting new age in promotion of our profession, profession of safety and health engineering.

Most of the writings start with the need of occupational safety and health trough describing the number of people killed on their work places. Well... that's wrong! Occupational safety and health does not have anything with those tragic numbers and ill fate human destinies. All this numbers show what it means when occupational safety and health is not present. Represent the full color of human ignorant belief that accident happens to other people. That occupational diseases are just diseases that strike underdeveloped countries or societies that do not value human life like ours do. When protection at work goes without saying since "all of us" know best what our job is all about.

No. 

Protection at work is all about prevention. In the ancient times, people who knew to predict future were often considered as people who were Gods favorite and who best interpret their desires. Todays that task belongs to the scientists, and one part of that is reserved for the occupational safety and health engineers. Part of preventing accidents at work. Many ignorant consider that it is easy task, and it is something that naturally comes to everyone of us. Its not. It takes open mind  and 360 ste-radians perception in order logically to deduct potential risk and based upon previously accumulated vast ocean of knowledge to recommend steps to mitigate the risk.

So here we are, at the beginning of year 2016, we are starting one project that will help us in the Balkan region, to increase the capacities of the occupational safety and health professionals and promote their role in improvement of the working conditions trough dialogue and exchange of experience with peers from the region and European Union, as well stakeholders.

So what are you waiting? Come and join us in developing our profession and setting new standards for the one who will follow. 

It is you that we need! Safety starts with YOU!
